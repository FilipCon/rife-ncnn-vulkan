* Introduction
This project is a simplified version of the [[https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan][rife-ncnn-vulkan]] repository. The
project is a ncnn implementation of RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation
for Video Frame Interpolation). It uses ncnn project as the universal neural
network inference framework.

* Project description
The current repository manages to build a watered down but more organized
library (=.dll= on Windows, =.so= on Linux), that was meant to be used as a plugin
for frame interpolation in Unity3D.

* Note to self
- Many features of the original project were not implemented.
- It is not guaranteed that it will work correctly in other systems.
- Execution is very slow, even when using the GPU (~1.5sec).
